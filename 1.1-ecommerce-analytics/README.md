# RFM Segmentation

RFM segmentation is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively the importance of a customer to a business based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value of their purchases.

## Key Concepts
- **Recency**: How recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who have purchased recently are more likely to respond positively to promotions.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase. Customers who purchase more frequently are typically more loyal.
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends. Higher spending customers are often more valuable to a business.

## RFM Analysis Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical purchase data for your customers.
2. **Calculate RFM Scores**: Score each customer on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics based on the gathered data.
3. **Segmentation**: Segment customers into groups based on their RFM scores (e.g., High Value, Medium Value, Low Value).
4. **Targeting**: Use these segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Conclusion
RFM segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. It's a valuable tool for increasing customer retention, boosting sales, and enhancing overall business performance.
