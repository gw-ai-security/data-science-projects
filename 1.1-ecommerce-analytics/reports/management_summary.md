# Management Summary — Online Retail KPI Analysis

## Goal of the analysis
Provide a concise view of revenue performance, customer concentration, and product contribution to support merchandising, inventory planning, and account management decisions.

## Key findings
- Revenue is highly concentrated: the United Kingdom and a small set of customers account for the majority of sales, indicating dependency risk.
- Seasonality is visible with end-of-year peaks, which affects inventory, staffing, and marketing timing.
- A limited set of SKUs drives a disproportionate share of revenue; these products are critical for availability and margin protection.

## Risks / data limitations
- The dataset covers one year only, so long-term trends and structural shifts cannot be confirmed.
- Returns and cancellations can affect net revenue and may bias customer and SKU rankings.
- Customer identifiers are incomplete for some transactions, which limits segmentation depth.

## Recommended next actions
- Establish a customer segmentation (RFM) to target retention and reduce reliance on top customers.
- Align inventory and promotions with seasonal peaks identified in the monthly revenue trend.
- Develop a top-SKU availability plan and monitor stockout risk for the highest-revenue items.
